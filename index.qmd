title: 'Leadville Results Analysis'
---
A series of blog posts detailing how I scraped, cleaned, and analyzed
race data from the [Leadville Trail 100 Run](https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/run/leadvilletrail100run/).

This site was generated with [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 
and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). 
The source code that generated it can be found in 
[one of my github repos](https://github.com/aaron-schroeder/leadville-analysis).
